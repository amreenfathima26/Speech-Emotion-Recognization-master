# For this user, they might want to commit the model if they had one, but keeping exclusions for safety if files are huge
# But user wants "1000% work", if they had a model it should be included.
# However, user doesn't have it yet. I will Un-ignore .pkl just in case they generate it and want to push it.
# But original gitignore had it. I will keep data/ ignored but allow .pkl if small, but let's stick to standard practice.
# Actually, the user asked for "no error".
